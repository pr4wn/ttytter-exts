UPGRADING FROM EARLIER VERSIONS

A bug was spotted by @18is9 in which pwntter would crash when logging
track items:

DBD::mysql::st execute failed: Column 'user_id' cannot be null at pwntter.pl line 100.
DBD::mysql::st execute failed: Column 'user_id' cannot be null at pwntter.pl line 100.

The reason for this is the twitter API JSON record is very different when
displaying a track item to a user stream item.

To accommodate both data structures, I have had to update the database
scehema for tweets which can be found in the file sql/patch.sql. Run the 
sql in this file before using the new version of pwntter.

New installations of pwntter can ingnore this.
