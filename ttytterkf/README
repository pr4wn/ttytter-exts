              ttytterkf - a killfile extension for TTYtter


Please read the TTYtter documentation on how to run extensions first.

ttytterkf performs an extended function to the -filter directive that is provided by TTYtter.

The filter function is limited in that it can only filter on tweet text. 
ttytterkf addresses this by allowing you to set any rule using a wider range of
data.

                             TO RUN

Either:

from the command line: ttytter -exts=/full/path/to/ttytterkf

or

edit your rc file (usually ~/.ttytterrc) thus:

exts=/full/path/to/ttytterkf

I have incuded a sample rules file to get you going. [sample_rules.txt]
as well as a samples whitelist [whitelist_sample.txt] which will override any
killfile conditions.

The default rules file is $HOME/.ttytterkillfile 
The default whitelist file is $HOME/.ttytterwhitelist 

To use different filenames, you will have to edit the $kffn and $wlfn variables
in ttytterkf.
